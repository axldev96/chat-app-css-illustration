## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge I have learned to better handle relative and absolute positioning, I have learned more about gradients (something that I had never really worked on without a gradient generator). This design for me was really challenging so I'm happy but not satisfied with the result. I want to improve!

### Continued development

I want to continue working with CSS and begin to apply more advanced concepts and improve the ones I know right now. Making gradients more dynamic and precise, improving the positioning of elements with media queries, grid and flexbox.
